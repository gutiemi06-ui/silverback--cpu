# silverback--cpu
Silverback CPU is a custom single-cycle CPU built in Logisim-Evolution featuring a user-defined 8-bit instruction set architecture (ISA). The project includes a complete datapath implementation, load/store memory operations, and a Python assembler that translates custom assembly code into machine code executable within the CPU.
